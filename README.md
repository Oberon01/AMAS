# AMAS: Archetypal Model Alignment System

The AMAS system is a symbolic cognition engine that aligns individuals to abstract cognitive models based on a 10-dimensional trait vector.

## Contents
- `amas/` – Core engine modules
- `amas_overlay_simulation.py` – Example simulation script
- `AMAS_Symbolic_Metadata.json` – Symbolic metadata for model overlay logic
- Trait weightings and penalties for ensemble modeling
- Narrative neighborhood clustering logic

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib (if running visualization)
- Custom internal modules found in `amas/`

## Usage
To run a symbolic alignment:
1. Define a subject with a 10-length trait vector.
2. Run `amas_overlay_simulation.py`
3. The script will output:
   - Top model match
   - Cluster neighbors
   - Ensemble top 3 predictions

This system is under continuous development. Contact the author for updates or advanced symbolic profiling integration.
