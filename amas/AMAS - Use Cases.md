# AMAS â€“ Use Cases

This document outlines potential real-world and symbolic use cases for the **Algorithmic Model Alignment System (AMAS)**. These serve as reference for applications, extensions, and system justification.

---

## 1. Personal Symbolic Development

### Description:
Use AMAS to align oneself with an aspirational symbolic mental model.

### Benefits:
- Identify personal blind spots
- Move toward desired cognitive traits
- Strengthen symbolic cohesion and narrative identity

---

## 2. Relational Compatibility Simulation (RRA/SRA)

### Description:
Model how two individuals align toward a shared symbolic mental model in romantic or social contexts.

### Benefits:
- Reveal sources of tension or harmony
- Guide mutual growth through aligned frameworks
- Facilitate symbolic resonance rituals

---

## 3. Archetype-Based Scenario Testing

### Description:
Overlay archetypes on simulated subjects and test how different mental models impact outcomes.

### Benefits:
- Predict behavioral shifts under model alignment
- Design tailored symbolic interventions
- Model identity changes over time

---

## 4. Cognitive Coaching & Mentorship

### Description:
Used by mentors or symbolic guides to help someone transition between current and aspirational models.

### Benefits:
- Structure transformation plans
- Provide clear metaphoric tools
- Track progress with symbolic feedback

---

## 5. Cultural Resonance Mapping (CRF)

### Description:
Map how symbolic models spread within or clash against cultural frameworks.

### Benefits:
- Predict adoption likelihood of mental models
- Detect symbolic resistance patterns
- Guide cultural communication strategy

---

## 6. Simulation Framework Plug-in (Generic Mode)

### Description:
Embed AMAS into broader simulations as an interpretive engine to guide decisions, forecasts, or symbolic loops.

### Benefits:
- Provide interpretive narrative logic to agents
- Increase simulation depth and symbolic realism
- Link models to story-based outcomes

---

## 7. Professional Development & Organizational Coaching

### Description:
Use AMAS within teams to align individuals to roles, communication styles, or vision frameworks.

### Benefits:
- Reduce philosophical friction
- Guide employee growth paths symbolically
- Evaluate team-model resonance gaps

---

## 8. AI Symbolic Interpretation Layer (Future Integration)

### Description:
Provide LLMs or symbolic AI systems with model alignment logic to mimic human cognitive transitions.

### Benefits:
- Add psychological believability
- Tune AI responses by model alignment
- Enable identity-aware agents in simulations
