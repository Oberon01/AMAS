# AMAS – System Architecture

This document outlines the internal architecture of the **Algorithmic Model Alignment System (AMAS)**. It details how the system processes cognitive data, maps it to symbolic models, calculates symbolic distance, and constructs a guided alignment pathway using narrative, metaphor, and prompts.

---

## 1. Input Profiler

### Purpose:
Capture structured cognitive information from the user or subject.

### Inputs:
- Cognitive trait scores (from CCM)
- Narrative samples or symbolic responses
- Archetype overlays (optional)

### Output:
A structured profile object, formatted for analysis:
```json
{
  "symbolic_capacity": 7,
  "system_awareness": 6,
  "meta_cognition": 4,
  "paradigm_flexibility": 5,
  "cognitive_containment": 6,
  "epistemic_clarity": 7
}
```

## 2. Model Repository

Holds the complete set of symbolic mental models (30+), each with:
- 10 structured sections (Identity → Integration)
- Class (e.g., Interpretive, Relational, Meta-Model)
- Internal pattern mappings

Stored as markdown files or JSON entries with a shared schema.

## 3. Trait–Model Mapping Matrix

### Purpose:
Map profile traits to symbolic dimensions of the models.

| Trait | Symbolic Dimension |
|-------|--------------------|
| Symbolic Capacity | Core Identity, Narrative Invocation |
| System Awareness | System Interactions, Cognitive Engine |
| Meta-Cognition | Meta-Model relevance, Frame fluidity |
| Paradigm Flexibility | Model compatibility, conflict handling |
| Cognitive Containment | Usage Integration, Shadow Form |
| Epistemic Clarity | Resonance, Symbolic Tool usage |

---

## 4. Gap Engine

### Function:
Compares current profile vector to target model vector.

### Outputs:
- Delta scores per trait
- Alignment difficulty score (0–100)
- Symbolic stress areas
- Trait reinforcement targets

---

## 5. Transition Engine

### Components:
| Name | Function |
|------|----------|
| Metaphor Generator | Builds symbolic prompts for difficult trait shifts |
| Ritual Sequencer | Recommends symbolic tasks to reinforce new patterns |
| Question Forge | Asks self-reflective prompts for each delta gap |
| Archetypal Alignment Tool | Suggests temporary archetypes to invoke shift |

---

## 6. Feedback Layer

### Features:
- Short- and long-term evaluation of trait shift
- Symbolic regression detectors
- History-aware recommendations (what worked before)

---

## 7. CLI Interface

- Run alignment analysis from the command line
- Choose model target by name
- Export report or transition guidance
- Optional archetype overlay with `--use-archetypes` flag

---

## 8. Integration Touchpoints

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| CCM | Input trait data |
| RRA/SRA | Validate relationship model alignment |
| CRF | Model propagation over cultural timelines |
| Generic Framework | Serve as interpretive engine in simulations |

---

## Suggested File Outputs

- `model_profile.json` — Subject profile data
- `alignment_gap.json` — Symbolic gap scores
- `alignment_plan.md` — Step-by-step symbolic alignment pathway
- `transition_log.json` — Tracks changes over time

## Key Architectural Principles

- **Symbolic over statistical**: Primacy of metaphor and narrative in cognition
- **Modular cognition**: Flexible composition of models and traits
- **Alignment through resonance**: Leverages psychological mythic triggers
- **Preserve autonomy**: No coercion, only guided self-recognition
