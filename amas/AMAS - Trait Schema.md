# AMAS Trait Schema

This file defines the 10 core cognitive dimensions used by the Archetypal Model Alignment System (AMAS) to map symbolic mental models to individual cognitive profiles.

## Trait Score Ranges

Each trait is rated on a **1–10 scale**. These ranges help interpret how the trait might manifest:

| Score Range | Classification     | Description                                                        |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1–3         | Low Expression      | Indicates minimal or hindered expression of the trait              |
| 4–6         | Moderate Expression | Suggests functional but situational or inconsistent expression     |
| 7–8         | High Expression     | Represents strong, regular, and reliable cognitive engagement      |
| 9–10        | Mastery Expression  | Symbolic dominance or deep cognitive integration of the trait      |

Use these levels to calibrate personal profiles, model alignment accuracy, and target developmental shifts in cognition or symbolic training.


## Trait Definitions

### 1. Symbolic Capacity
**Definition:** The ability to process and operate through metaphor, abstraction, and archetypal representation.  
**Low (1–3):** Literal thinking, low metaphor tolerance, concrete perception.  
**High (8–10):** Fluid symbol usage, intuitive with archetypes, abstract narrative synthesis.

### 2. System Awareness
**Definition:** Awareness of recursive structure, interdependence, and layered systems.  
**Low:** Focus on isolated elements; linear cause-effect thinking.  
**High:** Thinks in loops, systems, and multi-scale feedback patterns.

### 3. Meta-Cognition
**Definition:** The ability to reflect on one’s own cognitive processes.  
**Low:** Unaware of internal logic or reasoning process.  
**High:** Can track and adjust own thoughts, frameworks, and mental behavior.

### 4. Paradigm Flexibility
**Definition:** Ability to switch between or reframe interpretive systems.  
**Low:** Rigid framework loyalty; resistant to new perspectives.  
**High:** Agile across models; embraces contradiction as generative.

### 5. Cognitive Containment
**Definition:** Capacity to maintain symbolic boundaries and prevent overload.  
**Low:** Tends to sprawl; uncontained symbolic flooding.  
**High:** Organized symbolic containers; coherent, self-bound cognition.

### 6. Epistemic Clarity
**Definition:** Coherence and transparency of knowledge processes.  
**Low:** Relies on fuzzy logic, emotional distortion, or unexamined belief.  
**High:** Understands the structure of belief and method behind knowing.

### 7. Temporal Projection
**Definition:** Ability to model time, anticipate futures, and simulate sequences.  
**Low:** Present-biased, impulsive, or rigid past dependence.  
**High:** Projects timelines, forecasts emergent paths, narratively or logically.

### 8. Narrative Coherence
**Definition:** Symbolic consistency between thought, behavior, and identity.  
**Low:** Disjointed symbolic expression, fragmented belief-action loop.  
**High:** Lives within consistent mythos, coherent symbolic arc.

### 9. Shadow Awareness
**Definition:** Recognition of unconscious patterns, avoidance, and distortions.  
**Low:** Unaware of projections, blind spots, and internal sabotage.  
**High:** Tracks own mythic inversions and symbolic dysfunctions.

### 10. Alignment Receptivity
**Definition:** Openness to integrating new symbolic models into one’s internal architecture.  
**Low:** Rejects external input, protects existing schema.  
**High:** Curious, porous, capable of deep model integration.

## Usage

Each subject or profile is assessed on a scale from **1–10** across all 10 traits.

These vectors are then compared against the symbolic model matrix to assess **alignment proximity**, **gaps**, and **model fit**.

This schema underpins all AMAS simulations, CLI tools, and archetype recommendations.
