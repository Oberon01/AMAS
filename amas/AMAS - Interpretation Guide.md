# AMAS Interpretation Guide

This guide explains how to accurately interpret the results generated by the **Archetypal Model Alignment System (AMAS)** and apply them meaningfully in symbolic, relational, cognitive, or strategic contexts.

---

## 🧠 1. Raw Score

**Definition:**  
The cosine similarity between your 10-dimensional trait vector and each model in the matrix.

**Interpretation:**  
- Ranges from 0.0 (no similarity) to 1.0 (perfect match)
- A score above **0.95** typically indicates strong symbolic alignment
- Use this score to **rank model proximity** to your cognitive signature

---

## 📊 2. Normalized Score

**Definition:**  
Each score is divided by the highest score in the result set to create a 0–1 scale.

**Interpretation:**  
- Useful for **relative comparisons** within one run
- Helps identify models that are **within the symbolic orbit** of the top match

---

## 📉 3. Distance from Top

**Definition:**  
How much a model lags behind the top model, in cosine space.

**Interpretation:**  
- A small distance (e.g. < 0.01) means **nearly identical resonance**
- A larger distance means diminishing symbolic influence

---

## 🔬 4. Trait Contribution Analysis

**Definition:**  
Dot product of your trait score and each model’s trait weight for each of the 10 traits.

**Interpretation:**  
- High values show traits that are **driving the alignment**
- Use this to understand **why** a model ranks highly
- Also reveals **overweight or underweight traits**

---

## 🧬 5. Symbolic Model Clustering

**Definition:**  
Models grouped based on shared trait patterns using KMeans clustering.

**Interpretation:**  
- Clusters often correspond to **thematic archetypes or symbolic families**
- Use your best-fit cluster to explore **alternate alignments** that share narrative purpose

---

## 🌐 6. Radar Chart

**Definition:**  
Visual overlay of your trait profile and the top model’s traits.

**Interpretation:**  
- Where your shape and the model shape match = **cognitive resonance**
- Gaps or spikes = areas of symbolic divergence or unexplored potential

---

## 🧭 Application Contexts

**Romantic Compatibility (RRA):**
- Look for shared resonance in narrative coherence and alignment receptivity
- Compare radar charts between partners for symbolic balance or polarity

**Social Dynamics (SRA):**
- Use model cluster to guide team roles or social contribution
- Emphasize trait compatibility in containment and projection

**Cultural Integration (CRF):**
- Models aligned with symbolic capacity and temporal projection suggest mythic anchoring
- Use identity drift or propagation models to evaluate public narrative fit

---

## 📌 Recommendations

- Never interpret the top result in isolation — always consider the **top 3–5**.
- Pay attention to **outliers**: models with high alignment but different symbolic classes.
- Re-run the simulation in different **contextual scenarios** (e.g., mentorship, leadership, integration).
- Use trait contribution analysis to **guide personal development** toward models you wish to align with.
