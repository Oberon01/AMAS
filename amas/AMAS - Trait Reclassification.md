# AMAS Trait Reclassification Guide

This guide outlines the structural purpose of each symbolic trait in the recalibrated model vector space. Traits are no longer just characteristics â€” they function as **geometric shapers** of the symbolic resonance field.

## ðŸ§© Trait Roles

### 1. Symbolic Capacity â€” **Separator**
- **Function:** Increases symbolic dimensionality, pushes abstract-heavy models away from literal-heavy models.
- **High:** Archetypal, abstract thinkers
- **Low:** Literal or system-constrained models

### 2. System Awareness â€” **Anchor**
- **Function:** Grounds models in procedural, systemic logic.
- **High:** Systems thinkers, process engineers
- **Low:** Symbolic or interpretive free-formers

### 3. Meta-Cognition â€” **Separator**
- **Function:** Differentiates self-aware, recursive models from reactive or static models.
- **High:** Reflexive, paradox-resilient archetypes
- **Low:** Action- or belief-driven modes

### 4. Paradigm Flexibility â€” **Separator**
- **Function:** Pushes models into different reality-frame tolerances (rigid vs. adaptive).
- **High:** Shapeshifters, reframers
- **Low:** Foundational, rule-based logic

### 5. Cognitive Containment â€” **Filter**
- **Function:** Constrains symbolic sprawl; models must retain coherent internal structure.
- **High:** Structured reasoners
- **Low:** Loose, emotionally driven symbols

### 6. Epistemic Clarity â€” **Filter**
- **Function:** Forces models to choose between certainty vs. ambiguity.
- **High:** Precision models
- **Low:** Interpretive or poetic structures

### 7. Temporal Projection â€” **Anchor**
- **Function:** Roots models in timeline logic â€” past/future thinking.
- **High:** Strategic, causal systems
- **Low:** Identity-driven, ahistoric archetypes

### 8. Narrative Coherence â€” **Anchor**
- **Function:** Ensures the model is tethered to a symbolic story or meaning arc.
- **High:** Identity- or myth-based models
- **Low:** Analytical/logical fragments

### 9. Shadow Awareness â€” **Filter**
- **Function:** Exposes hidden tensions, repressions, or symbolic dualities.
- **High:** Integrators and depth models
- **Low:** Surface-level or aspirational ideals

### 10. Alignment Receptivity â€” **Filter**
- **Function:** Measures how "open" a model is to symbiotic alignment.
- **High:** Cooperative, adaptive archetypes
- **Low:** Isolated, totalizing models
