# Scenario-Specific Interpretation â€“ AMAS 

This document outlines how alignment scores are interpreted differently based on simulation scenario context.

## Scenario Contexts

### 1. Romantic Resonance Architecture (RRA)
- **Priority Dimensions**: Emotional Calibration, Symbolic Alignment, Paradigm Flexibility
- **Interpretation Focus**: Emotional rhythm, symbolic mirroring, relational timing
- **Example**: A high match in Meta-Cognition & Emotional Calibration suggests symbolic attunement in conflict resolution and inner-world mirroring.

---

### 2. Social Resonance Architecture (SRA)
- **Priority Dimensions**: System Awareness, Pattern Recognition, Cognitive Containment
- **Interpretation Focus**: Cooperative scaffolding, social rhythm, tension quality
- **Example**: High alignment in System Awareness & Pattern Recognition implies seamless mutual tracking and social responsiveness.

---

### 3. Cultural Resonance Framework (CRF)
- **Priority Dimensions**: Symbolic Capacity, Epistemic Clarity, Symbolic Alignment
- **Interpretation Focus**: Cultural transmission, ideological formation, symbolic echoes
- **Example**: A match in Symbolic Capacity & Epistemic Clarity reveals a potential myth-bearing or message propagation alignment.

---

### 4. Mentorship
- **Priority Dimensions**: Meta-Cognition, Paradigm Flexibility, Philosophical Depth
- **Interpretation Focus**: Asymmetrical growth dynamics, mentor-protege cycles
- **Example**: High alignment in Philosophical Depth and low in Paradigm Flexibility may indicate a structured but rigid mentorship potential.

---

### 5. Generic
- **Priority Dimensions**: All weighted equally
- **Interpretation Focus**: Abstract symbolic compatibility
- **Example**: A uniform alignment across traits reflects a cognitively balanced pairing across unknown or emergent contexts.
