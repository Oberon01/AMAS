# AMAS – Algorithmic Model Alignment System

The **Algorithmic Model Alignment System (AMAS)** is a symbolic cognitive engine designed to assess a person's current mental architecture, calculate their symbolic distance from a target model, and guide them through structured prompts, metaphors, and transition sequences to *align them with the chosen symbolic model*.

This project is part of the broader symbolic cognition ecosystem and interfaces with RRA, SRA, CRF, and CCM frameworks.

## Core Purpose

AMAS enables:
- Model-based cognitive alignment
- Symbolic transformation guidance through structured intervention
- Scalable simulation of mental growth or adaptation
- Controlled symbolic reinforcement over time

---

## System Objectives

- **Profile Extraction** – identify and quantify an individual’s cognitive structure
- **Model Matching** – match current profile to symbolic models in the mental model library
- **Gap Analysis** – compute symbolic delta between subject and target
- **Guided Alignment** – generate a transition path using prompts, metaphorical cues, and symbolic rituals
- **Adaptive Feedback** – refine suggestions based on alignment success or regression

## Components Overview

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `Input Profiler` | Gathers cognitive traits and patterns through structured prompts |
| `Model Repository` | Stores symbolic models in 10-section format (Core Identity → Usage Integration) |
| `Trait-Model Matrix` | Maps cognitive inputs to symbolic dimensions used in the models |
| `Gap Analysis Engine` | Identifies symbolic and structural distance from a target model |
| `Alignment Engine` | Generates metaphors, reflection exercises, and symbolic shifts |
| `Feedback Layer` | Tracks progression, regression, or symbolic instability across time |
| `CLI Tool` | Optional interactive interface for local evaluation and simulation |

## Use Cases

### Cognitive Growth Simulation
- Guide personal development by identifying compatible symbolic models
- Suggest shifts from reactive to reflective cognition

### Relational Alignment (via RRA or SRA)
- Test symbolic compatibility in relationships
- Align partners through shared model scaffolding

### Education & Training
- Teach individuals how to move from lower-order heuristics to symbolic models (e.g., Second-Order Thinking)
- Train future-state cognition (e.g., Simulation Literacy)

### Organizational Use
- Help leaders align their cognitive strategy with team model archetypes
- Reduce narrative friction in communication by shifting interpretive models

## Model Compatibility

Works with models structured in symbolic mental format:
- Core Symbolic Identity
- Central Metaphor
- Cognitive Engine
- Archetypal Role
- System Interactions
- Shadow Form
- Resonance & Incompatibility
- Narrative Invocation
- Symbolic Tool
- Usage Integration

## Ethical Notes

This system:
- Does **not** force transformation
- Respects symbolic autonomy of the user
- Operates with transparency and reflection-based reinforcement
- Is **not** a diagnostic tool — it is symbolic and cognitive, not clinical

## Related Systems

| System | Integration |
|--------|-------------|
| `CCM` | Uses trait metrics as input dimensions |
| `RRA / SRA` | Aligns models for compatibility, behavior shaping, or conflict transformation |
| `CRF` | Maps individual symbolic alignment to cultural propagation patterns |
| `Generic Simulation Framework` | Serves as symbolic filter for high-level simulations |
