# AMAS – Trait Mapping Specification

This document outlines how cognitive traits are structured, interpreted, and used for aligning subjects with symbolic mental models in the Algorithmic Model Alignment System (AMAS).

## Trait Structure

Each symbolic trait operates on a **0–10 scale**, where the numeric value represents strength or maturity along that trait's spectrum.

| Trait Name            | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Symbolic Capacity     | Ability to think in metaphor, archetype, and mythic logic |
| System Awareness      | Understanding interdependencies and dynamic systems |
| Meta-Cognition        | Awareness of one's own thought processes |
| Paradigm Flexibility  | Willingness to shift interpretive frameworks |
| Cognitive Containment | Ability to maintain symbolic coherence without fragmentation |
| Epistemic Clarity     | Discernment of knowledge boundaries and truth evaluation |

## Scoring Interpretation

| Range | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0–2   | Minimal: trait is underdeveloped or impaired |
| 3–4   | Basic: trait is situational or inconsistently accessed |
| 5–6   | Moderate: trait is functional and periodically stable |
| 7–8   | Strong: trait is regularly demonstrated with high reliability |
| 9–10  | Symbolic Mastery: trait is deeply integrated and fluid under stress |

## Trait-Model Influence

Each symbolic model is rated on how much it depends on or activates each trait. Scores are interpreted as **required alignment** thresholds or **activation dependencies**.

- A high score in "Paradigm Flexibility" for a model means that users low in this trait will struggle to align without transformation.
- Models do **not** require perfect matches. The gap analysis engine will quantify symbolic distance and generate a path for transformation.

## Use in Simulation

During alignment:
1. The subject’s input profile is normalized.
2. The model’s trait scores are treated as a vector.
3. Distance is computed as a form of symbolic dissonance.
4. Guidance is generated based on specific trait mismatches.

## Notes

- Traits are **not weighted equally** by default. Each model may emphasize certain traits more than others.
- Symbolic mismatch is not an error—it's an opportunity for symbolic growth.
